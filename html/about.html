            <p>Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced.
                Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
                I'm a good frined of Michael, though we had our ups and downs.
                My day-to-days are selling paper, watering the office plant, arranging the toys on Michael's desk.
                I'm also a former volunteer sheriff deputy, unfortunately I had to step down for some reason.
                I reside on my family's beet farm, alongside my cousin, Mose.
                I take Goju Ryu karate very seriously, and gained a black belt.
                And I can't believe Jim Halpert got promoted. Period.
            </p>
