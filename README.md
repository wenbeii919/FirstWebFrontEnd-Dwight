    <summary>landing page</summary>

- The landing page includes 3 animated components by using css, a block element of unordered listings, an external link in a new tab attached with "Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica" listing, and 3 internal links to other pages in the same window. 

- Interactive/animated components:
    1. the heading "BEET YOU!" uses blink animation
    2. the brief intro uses typewritter effect (would be more vivid if pause more seconds after each period)
    3. the navbar listings display underlines when hover on them

    <summary>"about me" page</summary>

- The "About Me" page simply consists of a rounded image and a paragraph. I was trying to make the text wrap the image by using shape-outside: circle(), but it didn't work. I assume it's about div layer?
